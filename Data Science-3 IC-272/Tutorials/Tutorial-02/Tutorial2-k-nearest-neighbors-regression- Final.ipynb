The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. I use min/max normalizer. The min-max normalizer linearly rescales every feature to the [0,1] interval. Rescaling to the [0,1] interval is done by shifting the values of each feature so that the minimal value is 0, and then dividing by the new maximal value (which is the difference between the original maximal and minimal values)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gJ0lm8YKA4Yo"},"source":["![](http://bilgisayarkavramlari.sadievrenseker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/normallesme6.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Gltbg7HaA4Yo","outputId":"7a190fba-4661-42be-fa16-7409a6c6aafa"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","      <th>mean</th>\n","      <th>std</th>\n","      <th>min</th>\n","      <th>25%</th>\n","      <th>50%</th>\n","      <th>75%</th>\n","      <th>max</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Horsepower</th>\n","      <td>406.0</td>\n","      <td>0.450129</td>\n","      <td>0.176177</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.326087</td>\n","      <td>0.406522</td>\n","      <td>0.560870</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Weight</th>\n","      <td>406.0</td>\n","      <td>0.387415</td>\n","      <td>0.240149</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.173944</td>\n","      <td>0.342926</td>\n","      <td>0.568543</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>MPG</th>\n","      <td>406.0</td>\n","      <td>0.494662</td>\n","      <td>0.180296</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.364807</td>\n","      <td>0.479614</td>\n","      <td>0.622318</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Displacement</th>\n","      <td>406.0</td>\n","      <td>0.327596</td>\n","      <td>0.271117</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.095607</td>\n","      <td>0.214470</td>\n","      <td>0.604651</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["              count      mean       std  min       25%       50%       75%  \\\n","Horsepower    406.0  0.450129  0.176177  0.0  0.326087  0.406522  0.560870   \n","Weight        406.0  0.387415  0.240149  0.0  0.173944  0.342926  0.568543   \n","MPG           406.0  0.494662  0.180296  0.0  0.364807  0.479614  0.622318   \n","Displacement  406.0  0.327596  0.271117  0.0  0.095607  0.214470  0.604651   \n","\n","              max  \n","Horsepower    1.0  \n","Weight        1.0  \n","MPG           1.0  \n","Displacement  1.0  "]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","knn_regression_data = (knn_regression_data - np.min(knn_regression_data))/(np.max(knn_regression_data) - np.min(knn_regression_data))\n","knn_regression_data.describe().T"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xFW0K_bWA4Yo"},"source":["When we examine the distribution of our normalized data, we see that the minimum value is equal to 0 and the maximum value is equal to 1."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mizu-t1fA4Yo"},"source":["I said that the data to be used in the regression model should be numerical.
